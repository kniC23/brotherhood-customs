            <li> Review from Josh – Prescott, AZ</li>

			<li>"I can’t say enough good things about Brotherhood Customs! My 2014 Ram 2500 with the 6.7 Cummins blew a head gasket at 540,000 miles, while I was hauling feed out to the ranch. I was in a tough spot, needing my truck back ASAP for work. These boys didn’t just rebuild my engine—they got me back on the road in less than two days!

			Their attention to detail, pricing, professionalism, and dedication to getting it done right was incredible. The truck runs stronger than ever, and I know I can rely on it for the long hauls across the ranch. If you need real mechanics who stand by their work, Brotherhood Customs is the place to go. Thanks again, fellas!"
